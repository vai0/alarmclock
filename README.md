#Wakey Alarm Clock Web App

An alarm clock app with weather forecasts meant to be used on your phone. This project was designed by [Xiaotong Yuchi](http://www.xiaotongyuchi.com/wakeyalarm).

The design was intended to be built on the iOS or Android platform. However, I wanted to challenge myself by building a dynamic web application that relies entirely on managing all logic, data, and the view locally.

####Goals for this project:
- Performant. The app must feel like a native app.
- Responsive design. UI shouldn't break on mobile devices
- Match spec'ed design
